# Jets Project
## Second week of graded work for SD
### Andy Wynyard, Skill Distillery Student

This week 2 project will include:
* OO programming.
* Inheritance.
* Interfaces.
* Some awesome jets.
* 

Had some issues with using .nextLine after .nextInt, but found the answer on stack overflow, thank god for that. Mostly pretty straightforward otherwise.

Need to learn more about inheritance, and constructors however, and specifics about their usage, and how I can more efficiently use them to project goals.

Sat evening TODO: Create an interface for the pilots, otherwise completed.
